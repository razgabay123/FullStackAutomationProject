# 🚀 Final Automation Project

This is a full-featured, multi-platform **test automation framework** built with Python. It supports **Web**, **Mobile**, **API**, **Desktop**, and **Electron** automation using a modular architecture based on the **Page Object Model (POM)**, **Workflows**, and **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)**. Integrated with **Allure Reports** for rich visual test reporting.
